Sim.One means Simplemachines One, The first Project from the Simplemachines team. It's a single board computer based on the low cost Cirrus Logic System-On-Chip EP9307. It delivers a set of flexible PC-Like interfaces such as RS232, two USB, VGA, headphone and microphone jacks and an add-on expansion connector for daughter boards.

Sim.One is free as in freedom: all the hardware specs (CAD files, schematics, BOM, etc) are available under a very flexible open hardware license (TAPR v1.0), so you are free to use, study, adapt or manufacture for your needs.
